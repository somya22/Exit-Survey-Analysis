# Exit-Survey-Analysis
This project mainly focuses on cleaning the employee exit survey datasets and doing analysis on the cleaned dataset.
We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

In this project, we'll try to answer the following questions:

1- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

2- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
